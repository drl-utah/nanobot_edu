% LAB 1 -- Toolchain Intro 1 - Changing Colors of the Onboard LED
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Congratulations! You've managed to set up and connect to the Arduino's 
% wifi network! Now that you have connected, we will use some functions as
% provided in nanobot.m as well as some MATLAB code to change the color of
% the onboard LED. Follow the instructions below and ask for help if you
% feel stuck

% Deliverables:
% - Set the onboard LED color
% - Make onboard LED blink at 5 Hz

% Possible Extensions:
% - Make the LED change colors every 2 seconds
% - Make the LED blink a different color every 5th blink, then return to
%   the original color.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% 1. CONNECT TO YOUR NANOBOT
%  Remember to replace the first input argument with text corresponding to
%  the correct serial port you found through the Arduino IDE. Note that the
%  clc and clear all will clear your command window and all saved
%  variables!

clc
clear all
nb = nanobot('COM7', 115200, 'wifi');

%% 2. SET LED BLINK RATE
% Set the onboard LED to blink at a rate of 5 Hz. Replace the ??? marks
% with appropriate values or variables.

% % Setup:
% ledFreq = ???;
% dtyCyc = ???; % have LED on for half the cycle period
% cyclePeriod = 1/???;
% onTime = ??? * ???;
% offTime = ??? - ???;
% 
% tic
% while(toc < ???)  % Choose how long you want the LED to blink for (in seconds)
%     nb.ledWrite(???);
%     pause(???);
%     nb.ledWrite(???);
%     pause(???);
% end

% Solution:
% Setup:
ledFreq = 5;
dtyCyc = 0.5; % have LED on for half the cycle period
cyclePeriod = 1/ledFreq;
onTime = cyclePeriod * dtyCyc;
offTime = cyclePeriod - onTime;

% Loop portion (easy loop)
tic
while(toc < 5)
    nb.ledWrite(1);
    pause(onTime);
    nb.ledWrite(0);
    pause(offTime);
end

%% 4. EXTENSION (optional)
%  Extension 1: Try changing the LED's color every two seconds.
%  Extension 2: Make the LED blink a different color every 5th blink, then 
%  return to the original color.
%
%  FIXME: Add corresponding code once RGB implementation is figured out.

%% 5. DISCONNECT
%  Clears the workspace and command window, then
%  disconnects from the nanobot, freeing up the serial port.

clc
clear all
%delete(nb); % DEBUG: I think clear all already does this?
clear('nb');
