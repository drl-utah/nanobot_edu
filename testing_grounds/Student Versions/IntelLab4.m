%% Intelligence Lab 4: Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks & Network Architecture

% the goal of this lab is to train a neural network to detect numbers gestured
% with an accelerometer. At a minimum you need to be able to reliably
% distinguish between ZERO, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT,
% and NINE with at least 75% accuracy. You will be responsible for
% modifying the neural network architecture to achieve this goal

%% Specify initial parameters:
trialCount = 5; % specify how many times you will make each gesture
digits = [0:9]; % specify which digits you will be gesturing
numreads = 100; % about 1.5 seconds (on serial)
vals = zeros(3,numreads);
%% Collect Multiple Gesture
gestureCount = length(digits); % determine the number of gestures
data = cell(gestureCount, trialCount+1); % preallocate cell array
for i = 1:gestureCount
    data{i,1} = digits(i);
