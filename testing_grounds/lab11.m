% LAB 11 -- Encoders and PID control of a DC motor
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% In this lab you will work IN TEAMS to tune a PID controller that sets a
% DC motor duty cycle to achieve a desired wheel speed and stabilizes any internal
% turning motion. Low level controllers like this are critical for wheeled
% robot motion, and will be necessary for your project!
%
% Deliverables:
%   - Find your encoder's approximate sampling frequency
%   - Target 10% duty cycle in speed with amplitude oscilations less than
%   2%, and a rise time of less than 500 ms.
%   
% Extensions:
%   - Use an additional PID loop to stabilize the robot's turning using the
%   encoder counts.

%% 2. Approximating the encoder's sampling frequency
% To gain an approximation of the encoder's sampling frequency, we want to
% figure out how many times it can sample over a period of time (say, a second)
% without experiencing aliasing artifacts. Beyond a certain motor speed, we
% will not recieve accurate counts. Experiment around to try and find the
% encoder's approximate sampling frequency.

% wraparound with the encoder.

% nb.setMotor(2,0);

% Did val.counts samples in runtime sec, calculate sample freq:
sampleFreq = abs(val.counts / runtime);


% disp(vals) %hint: if this is how many samples you got in runtime, then what is the sampling frequency?

% Answer: It seems that the highest value I can read in counts over 1
% second is around 3k at a duty cycle of 14%, so the sample frequency must be at least that
% much. The sign of the duty cycle corresponds to the direction in which
% the motor spins.

%% Creating a PID controller
% In this section, we will be using a PID controller to approach a given
% duty cycle value smoothly over time. You will need to tune your PID
% parameters in order to get your motor signal output 10% duty cycle with
% amplitude oscilations less than 2%, and a rise time of less than 500 ms.
