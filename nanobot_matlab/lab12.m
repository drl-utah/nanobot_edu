% ECE 3610
% LAB 12 -- PID-Based Line Following
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% In this lab, you will be working in teams to create a PID feedback loop
% and use it to tune a robot to smoothly follow a black line on a white
% background. Line following will be a core part of your final project, so
% it's good to get some experience with it early!
%
% Deliverables:
%   - Demonstrate that your robot accurately and smoothly follows a provided line
%   without losing tracking.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% WIRING
% This lab has lots of wiring! Be sure to check out the wiring diagram on
% Canvas to map all of the wires where they need to go. Double check this
% before connecting the Arduino to power.

%% 1. CONNECT TO YOUR NANOBOT (SUPER SPECIAL WIFI EDITION)
%  Remember to replace the first input argument with text corresponding to
%  the correct serial port you found through the Arduino IDE. Note that the
%  clc and clear all will clear your command window and all saved
%  variables!

% NOTE: This is the first time we will be connecting to our robot via
% Wi-Fi. Make sure to change string to specify 'wifi' as the third parameter in
% the nanobot() function. Your port should be identical to the one you've
% been using in previous labs.
% Make sure you're connected to the Arduino's wifi network before you
% connect here.

fprintf('one: %.2f, two: %.2f, three: %.2f four: %.2f five: %.2f six: %.2f\n', vals.one, vals.two, vals.three, vals.four, vals.five, vals.six);
minReflectance  = [120,16,96,96,84,108]; % Set me to minimum reflectance values for each sensor

%% LINE FOLLOWING PID LOOP
% Though PID tuning can be tedious and frustrating at times, the payoff is
% often worth it! A well-tuned PID system can be surprisingly redundant.
% Good luck, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you're stuck.

% IMPORTANT NOTE: When your battery is getting low, the red LEDs on the underside of
% the reflectance array will turn off and you won't be able to read any
% reflectance values. It is likely that your WiFi connection will become
% unstable as well, if not fail completely. If you suspect that your
% battery is dead, grab an instructor's attention and they will swap your
% battery for a fully charged one.

nb.initReflectance();
vals = nb.reflectanceRead();

% NOTE: Your motors may not turn at the same rate when fed the same duty
% cycle, meaning your robot will constantly drift to one side, which can
% make tuning difficult.
% To combat this, you can make a new section such as:
% nb.setMotor(1, duty);
% nb.setMotor(2, mOffScale * duty);
% pause(2)
% nb.setMotor(1, 0);
% nb.setMotor(2, 0);
% to find a factor mOffScale that roughly makes your robot go in a straight
% line. Apply this to the control signal of the stronger/weaker motor to
% even out the speed difference.
%
% Motor offset factor:
mOffScale = 1.2;

% TUNING:
% Start small (ESPECIALLY with the reflectance values, error can range from zero to several thousand!)
% Tip: when tuning kd, it must be the opposite sign of kp to damp
kp = 0.0006; % Was 0.0006
ki = 0.0;
kd = -0.0001; % was -0.00015

% Basic initialization
vals = 0;
prevError = 0;
prevTime = 0;
integral = 0;
derivative = 0;

% Determine a threshold to detect when white is present on all sensors
whiteThresh = 200; % Max value detected for all white

% The base duty cycle "speed" you wish to travel down the line with
% (recommended values are 9 or 10)
motor1BaseSpeed = 9;
motor2BaseSpeed = 9;

tic
% It can be helpful to initialize your motors to a fixed higher duty cycle
% for a very brief moment, just to overcome the gearbox force of static
% friction so that lower duty cycles don't stall out at the start.
% (recommendation: 10, with mOffScale if needed)
